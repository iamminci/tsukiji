# Fulfillment
In the spirit of OpenSea, Tsukiji serves as an open port for users to come with what they have, and leave with what they want. As such, we would like to expose an API, or an on-prem piece of software, that outside/third parties could use to help contribute to the flywheel that is having high velocity sales.

## BYO fulfillment:
Tsukiji provides:
- Collection of `offers` and `considerations` with all specified terms and metadata
- An SDK that enables any party to serve as matchmaker and fulfill orders

You provide:
- Fulfillment: kickstart a flywheel that benefits token traders, community members, and you the fulfiller!
